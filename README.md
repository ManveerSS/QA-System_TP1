# CSE360 Project: Educational Q&A System
The envisioned question-and-answer system for CSE360 streamlines the process of asking and answering questions by allowing students to specify whether answers work, preventing wasted effort. The system introduces trusted reviewers who evaluate answers to help students quickly find reliable solutions and assist answer providers in improving their responses. Students can manage a list of trusted reviewers to filter answers and feedback effectively. The instructional team oversees interactions, mentoring students and reviewers when needed, while system administrators manage user access and roles, ensuring smooth functionality. 

### Phase 1: 
The team is expected to implement input validation for all the input fields.  Recognize the similarities and factor out common work into helper methods.  Work together to select the best insights and work from the team member’s HW1 submissions.

The team must ensure that the new user stories set has been implemented and integrated into a well-functioning application.  These user stories may be incomplete, may conflict with one another, and maybe in error, just like in the real world outside of the university.  Your team is expected to address and resolve these issues by engaging with the stakeholders’ representative, your instructors.  The application must be documented like the provided code so others would assume it was the work of a single author.
